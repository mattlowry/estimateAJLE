Im new to this. I know this isnt the intented use for a readme.md but i dont have one. Im a small business owner, well the son of one, who left my careerr to help keep this company
afloat. Things were good for a while, we grew, we created a really solid online presence. But lately, hiring has been TOUGH. We are picky.. But thats only beacasue we care about our customers.
I discovered the use capabilities of AI and what not, 2-3 months ago. For those last 3 months ive spent 10 -12 hour running the business and another 8 hours triyng to learn all of this stuff. 
WIth the hopes it can solve alot of our internal problems. 

Ive managed to utlize different resources to get some soldid systems, i jsut need hlep finishing them. I think? 

Any suggestions or help is grately appreicated. or if there are any affordable developers, id consinder that. Or hey if you live in the DC , MD , VA area, Trade for electrical work?
